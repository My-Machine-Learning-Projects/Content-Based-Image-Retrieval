This was a project that I worked on as an intern at IIT Madras (May-July 2016).

My work invloved improving the online Smart CBIR interface and making it work in auto mode i.e. automatically, without any human intervention.

My internship contract forbids me from sharing any code used during the project. However, this repository contains my project report.
